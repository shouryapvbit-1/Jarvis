JARVIS - Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant

**Jarvis** is a Python-based voice-activated virtual assistant capable of performing tasks such as web browsing, playing music, fetching news, and responding to user queries using **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model**.  
It mimics the behavior of popular assistants like **Alexa** or **Google Assistant**, but is fully custom-built.
